# AI Healthcare Project: Diabetes Prediction  

## Overview  
This project uses Machine Learning to predict diabetes based on patient data.  

## Problem Statement  
Diabetes is a chronic disease that needs early diagnosis to prevent complications.  
This project aims to develop an AI model that can help detect diabetes risk efficiently.  

## Dataset  
- Source: Kaggle (Diabetes Dataset)  
- Features: Age, Blood Pressure, Glucose Level, etc.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-Learn for ML models  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization  

## Approach  
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Model Training & Evaluation  
4. Insights & Conclusion  

## Results  
- Best Model: Random Forest (Accuracy: 71%)  
- Key Insight: Glucose levels and BMI are strong indicators of diabetes risk.
