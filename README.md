# My-project
This project utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to develop a machine learning model that predicts diabetes based on health metrics such as glucose levels, BMI, and age. The model aims to assist in early diagnosis and intervention by analyzing these medical attributes. Technologies used include Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
